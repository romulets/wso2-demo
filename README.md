## Introduction

This project helps to understand how the communication flows shall happen and provides an example for further projects using java and the wso2 identity server.

This project has three entities which communicates among themselves:
- [Web Client (React)](src/main/resources/web-client)
- [Service Provider (Jersey)](src/main/java/romulets/wso2/rest)
- Wso2 Identity Server

_Obs: the web client built in react isn't the most wonderful code in the world. Please feel free to improve it :)_
